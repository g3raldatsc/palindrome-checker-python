# Palindrome Checker

A simple Python program that checks whether a given word, number, or phrase is a palindrome.  
It processes the input, removes spaces and special characters, and compares it with its reversed form.

---

## Description
A **palindrome** is a word, phrase, or number that reads the same forward and backward.  
For example:
- Words like `level`, `radar`, `madam`
- Numbers like `121`, `12321`
- Even phrases like `kasur ini rusak`

In this program, the user enters any text, and the program checks if it is a palindrome.  
All letters are converted to lowercase and non-alphanumeric characters are ignored,  
so it can detect palindromes even with spaces or punctuation.

## Example Output
``` bash

Checking...

"nababan" is a palindrome.
```
